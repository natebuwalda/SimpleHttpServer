How to Run
==========

1) Copy the compiled SimpleHttpServer-1.0.jar from the target directory to the desired
   location on your machine.
2) Create a subdirectory called 'site'.  Place any HTML files you would like to have
   served in this directory.
3) Return to the directory with the SimpleHttpServer jar in it.  Enter the following
   command: java -jar SimpleHttpServer-1.0.jar
4) Direct a browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/.  You should see a welcome page indicating
   that the server is running.
5) Any other served page can by accessed by adding the full file name to the host url.
   For example, if you have a page named 'index.html', you can access it by going to
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html.
